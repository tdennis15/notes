NOTES 11/14/2017
Registration on labs for winter 461. Just pick one, try to spread it out. There aren't assigned times.
Groups may be assigned by the end of this term. 
*****************************************************
Registering for GIPHY they give you api key, every request needs to send that key. Initial key is just a demo key. 
Avoid putting credentials on the github or repo pages/ or hash it somehow. 

Examples in RoutingExample project
*****************************************************
accessing a 'secret' api key

in the controller in the action result for index

public ActionResult Index(){
		//we want to request an encrypted version and then unwrap, Example retrieval outside of repo.
	string apiKey = System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["GiphyAPIKey"];
...
...
...
}

go to web config app settings ->

//we can merge appsettings, we want to merge a file outside of the project
<appSettings file="..\..\..\..\AppSettingsSecrets.config">
	<add key="GiphyAPIKey" value=" <whatever the api key is>"/>

in our AppSettingsSecrets.config a few folders up

<appSettings>
	<add key="GiphyAPIKey" value=" <whatever the api key is>"/>
</appSettings>

Then remove it from the web config settings, we had it there just to show that it would link. 

Now we have a file outside the file system that contains secured data that the project can use, 
but wont be saved as part of the project. 

This Works for passwords, keys and strings that dont belong in the project.
*****************************************************
Routing -> CH 15 asp.net mvc 5 book
Making new routes or update existing.

We made a view and controllers to try routing.

RouteData is given to the controller after the route has been created. We can pull values and check the mapping

note -> return View("ActionName"); will return a page of ActionName.cshtml, this overloads the default. 

if you don't give data when going to a site, it routes to the defaults in RouteConfig.cs/ usually home index
