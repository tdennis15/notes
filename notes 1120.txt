****************************************
For HW7 all requests to GIPHY must be through the server and not the client.
Client cant be allowed access to the API Key. 
****************************************
No Class tomorrow. Field trip to Portland
****************************************

Deploying in the CLoud. AZURE
	Using Example2 with a simple DB

3 Methods of deploying -> using cloud
Push Model
	Create a DB in the cloud
	Create an app
	Push to deploy from VS

Pull Model
	Set everything up
	Have the cloud pull the code

Automated
	Let the machine do it for you.
****************************************
PUSH MODEL -> Local Model has already been completed(built) with local DB and sql UpScript
Log in to Azure -> Dashboard -> Recieve 200$ -> feel limited to 32mb database size -> 

Step1 -> create database
	First create a RESOURCE GROUP (left nav bar)
	add -> "<Resource group name>" 
	Location -> West US
	Refresh
	SQL Databases -> add -> Name it -> subscription -> Resource group (what we just made) -> Blank DB -> 
			no elastic pool -> Add new server 
					Server name -> add it
					Server admin login/ password
		->pricing tier -> basic 5$/month -> Pin to dashboard

	Create web app 
	App Services 
	add -> web app -> app name -> resource group -> use existing ->west us -> pin to dash -> create

Check your new website

	Have DB, have Web app, Both deployed

Need to create DB tables, deploy app from local connecting to cloud DB

Nav to cloud DB
	->set server firewall
	rule name ->name of devie
	add the ip address. SAVE

Nav to Visual studio, log into your azure account.
	open project
	Look for azure DB
	open the new DB
		Sql server stuff and log into your DB with the azure info
	New query on 'DB name'
		Copy pasta the SQL upscript into a query on the remote data base. 
****************************************
Need to know the connection strings for the data base so that we can put it in our web application
	connection strings -> ado.net
	COPY PASTA 
	in VS 
	Web config 
	<connection strings>
	PASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	</connection strings>

This connects the local app with the remote DB

web app 
	applications settings
	connection strings
	PRIVATE

API keys can go here too
****************************************
Should just need to push code to the online application
(BUILD FIST or yolo)
build ->publish -> azure -> select existing -> double click the correct resource group
	It's ALIVE!
	Loads browser with the app (Claps quietly and sadly to self)
Might want to use Azure DB even when doing local development to get used to it.
