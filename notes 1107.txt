Notes Tuesday 11/7/2017
After Midterm
*********************************
HW6 -> FEATURE ONE | searching by category and subcategory in the database. Then display the products in a list or grid. 
not searching by keywords but just navigating through the database. Dont show results until user has selected
category and sub category. Then only show short listings or a paged version of the results. 

Dont want the auto generated pages for this.
*********************************
HW6 -> FEATURE TWO | Inserting new info into the database. The customer has the product ID or the DB knows the ID. 
Leaving a review, name email rating and a string review. The reviews then need to be visible. This is done by each 
product. 
*********************************
Building non trivial pages, requires in depth thought and thinking ahead.

*********************************
HW 7 -> Javascript and AJAX with an API from server. Building a page that searche Giphy for new Gifs. Needs to be 
Responsive and dynmaic. ONLY 1 PAGE. JS pings our server, our server pings GIPHY, giphy returns to server, server builds
javascript, javascript builds the page. ALL AJAX METHODS. 
Will need additional features, just to make it more complicated and maybe safer. 
*********************************
8/9 are equivalent to the final exam. NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN 2 HOURS TO PASS.
